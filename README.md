# king-james-functional

A Markov chain trained on the [King James Bible](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10) and [The Dao of Functional Programming by Bartosz Milewski](https://github.com/BartoszMilewski/DaoFP). (Basically like [King James Programming](https://kingjamesprogramming.tumblr.com/).)

## How to run this

Requirements: python3.10>=.

```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python fetch.py
python build_mc.py
python run_mc.py
```

## Examples

(*Obviously cherry-picked for hilariousness but **not terribly cherry-picked**.*)

> Cursed be he that doeth the work of the arrow f

> An identity arrow is a pair of proofs, one of friendship and one of the possession of the city

> Bring the meat into the chamber, and lay away their robes, in a locally small category

> Because of Haskell' s laziness, the execution of I/O is interleaved with the rest of the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Gad, and to the half tribe

> All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a unique function/arrow from Void to each one of them. All these functions are known under the same name: absurd.

> This says that, if S is fibered over B using q, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.

> For every pair of values there is, in principle, a separate type of proofs of equality. There is a type for 0 = 0, there is a type for 1 = 1, and there is a type for 1 = 1, and there is a spiritual body.

> That the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them were pure, and killed the passover for all the children of Israel : 32 : 29 And the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the danger of stack overflow.

> The proof of universality is analogous to the one for the initial algebra. As a consequence of the Lambek's lemma. To show that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.

> Again, not every h can be reduced to such a pair of arrows. For instance, the first   one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;

> And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and combine them with the result of the second function. This is not always possible, even for cases that we have studied so far, much less for an arbitrary type constructor.

> Using f ^- 1 from the previous exercise, evaluate β_y g for an arbitrary object y and an arbitrary arrow g a → y. As Lao Tzu would say, when things come together to form a   new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they to you

> There are infinitely many types in Haskell, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.

> This trick is at the core of the fold - left function, foldl. Care should be taken when using it, because of the sword which I will send among you.

> Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the program.

> This new continuation calls the previous continuation k, passing it the sum of the head of the daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his trespass offering.

> All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness , and there is a corresponding definition of the right strength. In a symmetric monoidal category, the two are equivalent.
